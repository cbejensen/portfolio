Referred to as “the local Angular expert,” I have taken charge of many design decisions of this enterprise application, both in performance and UX.

- Refactored the app to use Nx architecture and tooling, which resulted in a host of DX and build time improvements.
- Aligned code with CQRS methodologies.
- Created UI components based off Material UI design.
