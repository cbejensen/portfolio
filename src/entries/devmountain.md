DevMountain is a bootcamp focusing on front end web development, teaching terminal commands, git basics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was honored to be one of only 2 students chosen to present their final projects on graduation night. I returned for a 2nd cohort where I was introduced to React.

- Learned core features of the main front end languages.
- Created a real-world project interacting with the Spotify API.
