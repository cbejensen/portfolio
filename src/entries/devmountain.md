DevMountain is a bootcamp focusing on front end web development, teaching the command line, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I was honored to be one of only 2 students chosen to present their final projects on graduation night.

- Learned core features of the main front end languages.
- Created a real-world project SPA interacting with the Spotify API.
