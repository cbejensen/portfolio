Hello! My name is Christian, and I am a web developer in Salt Lake City, Utah. I graduated from DevMountain - a coding bootcamp - in 2015. Since then, I have worked extensively in JavaScript (and Typescript), primarily in Angular and React.

If you are interested in working with me, please [reach out](mailto:cbejensen@gmail.com)!
