        Hello! My name is {{ data.firstName }}, and I am a web developer. I
        graduated from DevMountain - a coding bootcamp - in 2015, and have been
        building things ever since. I currently work with FedEx using Angular. I
        also have a lot of experience with React, and love JavaScript in
        general.
      </p>
      <p>If you are interested in working with me, please reach out!</p>
